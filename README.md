Mental health and wellbeing is one of the key points for a good standard of living. Our project is developing a website that aims to reduce the 
mental health issues and promote wellbeing. The website will comprise of a Q&A, Articles regarding mental health, Mediation, Therapies and 
downloadable books for mental health. The website will have a user management system to manage the users in the site. The website will also 
be made in a user friendly and a simple manner to ensure minimal distraction and stress on the user. Website is designed to maximize the user 
engagement so that we can provide accurate feedback and relevant details for the user. The website will you the data from the users to accurately 
predict and develop the website to increase efficiency of the website. As students of SLIIT we have consulted a medical doctor and have used 
his input to develop the website. The website will have a soothing background music to help and calm any user that just visited the site. We 
believe that good mental health and proper well-being will raise the standards of living for people in Sri Lanka and all over the world. Because 
this website collects personal data from users, we will not sell any of the data to third parties.
